# Lung-Ultrasound-AI

This is the supporting code and write up of my dissertation for my MSc Computing Course at Cardiff University. It consists of the development of a tool for using neural networks to analyse critical artefacts that may be present in an ultrasound scan of the lungs in order to aid a medical professional. 

The dataset used to train this code is not publicly available. 

This code may not be reproduced without my explicit permission. 

As of now I am awaiting the final mark of this project. 

Technologies used were Python, PyTorch and many other machine learning libraries.
